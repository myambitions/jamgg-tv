# Television application

A Television application built with the following technologies:

- React + Redux + TypeScript
- Websockets with Socket.io
- Storybook

## Features

Not really features but I made 7th channel as a `Drawable` channel(eg. you can draw anything on that channel). Everything after 7th channel will be a `No signal` channel.
User cannot go below first channel.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
